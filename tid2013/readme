TAMPERE IMAGE DATABASE 2013 TID2013, version 1.0

TID2013 is intended for evaluation of full-reference image visual 
quality assessment metrics. TID2013 allows estimating how a given 
metric corresponds to mean human perception. For example, in 
accordance with TID2013, Spearman correlation between the metric 
PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) and mean human perception (MOS, 
Mean Opinion Score) is 0.69.

A New Color Image Database TID2013: Innovations and Results, 
Proceedings of ACIVS, Poznan, Poland, Oct. 2013, pp. 402-413.

The TID2008 contains 25 reference images and 3000 distorted images 
(25 reference images x 24 types of distortions x 5 levels of distortions). 
All images are saved in database in Bitmap format without any compression. 
File names are organized in such a manner that they indicate a number of 
the reference image, then a number of distortion's type, and, finally, a 
number of distortion's level: "iXX_YY_Z.bmp". 

For example, the name "i03_08_4.bmp" means the 3-rd reference image corrupted 
by the 8-th type of distortions with the 4-th level of this distortion.
Similarly, the name "i12_10_1.bmp" means that this is the 12-th reference 
image corrupted by the 10-th type of distortion with the first level. 
"i17.bmp" means that this is non-distorted 17-th reference image.

TABLE I. Types of distortion used in TID2008

ü       Type of distortion        

1       Additive Gaussian noise
2       Additive noise in color components is more intensive than additive noise in the luminance component
3       Spatially correlated noise
4       Masked noise
5       High frequency noise
6       Impulse noise
7       Quantization noise
8       Gaussian blur
9       Image denoising
10      JPEG compression
11      JPEG2000 compression
12      JPEG transmission errors
13      JPEG2000 transmission errors
14      Non eccentricity pattern noise
15      Local block-wise distortions of different intensity
16      Mean shift (intensity shift)
17      Contrast change
18      Change of color saturation
19      Multiplicative Gaussian noise
20      Comfort noise
21      Lossy compression of noisy images
22      Image color quantization with dither
23      Chromatic aberrations
24      Sparse sampling and reconstruction

See [1] for a more detailed explanation.

The file "mos.txt" contains the Mean Opinion Score for each distorted image.
The file "mos_with_names.txt" contains the same information and filenames of 
                              the coressponding distorted images.
The file "mos_std.txt" contains standard deviation of MOS for each 
                       distorted image.

The MOS was obtained from the results of 971 experiments carried out by 
observers from five countries: Finland, France, Italy, Ukraine and USA 
(116 experiments have been carried out in Finland, 72 in France, 80 in Italy, 
602 in Ukraine, and 101 in USA). Totally, the 971 observers have 
performed 524340 comparisons of visual quality of distorted images 
or 1048680 evaluations of relative visual quality in image pairs.

Higer value of MOS (0 - minimal, 9 - maximal) corresponds to higer visual 
quality of the image.

The following files contain values of some quality metrics calculated for 
the TID2008 images:

"psnrc.txt" - peak signal to noise ratio;
"psnr.txt" - peak signal to noise ratio calculated for the luminance component;
"ssim.txt" - values of the SSIM metric [3];
"mssim.txt" - vaules of the MSSIM metric [4,2];
"psnrhvs.txt" - values of the PSNR-HVS metric [5];
"psnrhvsm.txt" - values of the PSNR-HVS-M metric [6];
"psnrha.txt" - values of the PSNRHA metric [7];
"psnrhma.txt" - values of the PSNRHMA metric [7];
"vifp.txt" - pixel domain version VIF [8,3];
"nqm.txt" - values of the NQM metric [9,3];
"wsnr.txt" - values of the WSNR metric [10,3];
"vsnr.txt" - values of the VSNR metric [11,3];
"fsim.txt" - values of the FSIM metric [12];
"fsimc.txt" - values of color version of FSIM metric [12];

We plan to regularly update the versions of this database. New versions 
will include new types of distortion and take into account results of 
additional experiments.

We will highly appreciate authors of other metrics if they will inform 
us (please, mail to nikolay@ponomarenko.info) how to get executable 
files (e.g., Matlab codes) of their metrics. We guarantee that we 
will not pass them to other users and will include future results 
obtained for such metrics in analysis for our database.
